# histopathology_inflammation_estimation

Placemark for inflammation estimation project

In this paper, we propose an AI-based framework for the detection and estimation of inflammation activity in histopathological images. Our contributions can be summarized into 3 points: 

a) We propose a low-magnification inflammation annotation dataset that utilizes H\&E and PAS slides paired with adjacent section CD45 IHC. 

b) We present a computational pipeline that predicts the inflammation lesion in histopathology images. 

c) We present a computational pipeline that analyzes the population of inflammatory cells with respect to nuclei morphology, lesion morphology, proximity to renal vasculature. 

Codebase and dataset will be added soon
